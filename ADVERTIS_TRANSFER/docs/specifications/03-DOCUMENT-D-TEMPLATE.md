        name: "[e.g., 'Bold Simplicity']"
        definition: "[e.g., 'Remove until nothing else can be removed']"

```

**Example (Airbnb):**
```yaml
visual_identity_philosophy:
  core_idea: "Universal belonging expressed through warm, human-centered design"

  philosophy_statement: |
    Our visual identity reflects our belief that everyone can belong anywhere.
    We use warm, welcoming colors and imagery that celebrates diversity and
    human connection. Design should feel approachable, never exclusive or cold.

    The Bélo symbol represents people, places, love, and Airbnb - a visual
    expression of belonging. Our photography shows real people in real spaces,
    authentic and unpolished. Typography is friendly and legible across cultures.

    We occupy a distinctive space: warmer than tech companies, more modern than
    hospitality brands. We look like a global community, not a corporation.

  design_principles:
    - principle_1:
        name: "Embrace the Offbeat"
        definition: "Celebrate quirks and imperfections"
        application: "Authentic photography over stock, hand-drawn elements,
                      personality in layouts"

    - principle_2:
        name: "Create a Sense of Place"
        definition: "Design should feel rooted in location and culture"
        application: "Localized imagery, cultural color adaptations,
                      place-specific storytelling"

  visual_dna_keywords:
    - "Warm"
    - "Welcoming"
    - "Authentic"
    - "Human"
    - "Diverse"

  connection_to_brand_dna:
    personality_archetype: "Everyman (belonging) expressed through approachable design"
    values_expression: "Inclusion shown through diverse imagery; trust through transparency"
    positioning: "Local + authentic positioning = real photography, not staged"
```

      oklch: "oklch(66% 0.19 150)"

    color_meaning: |

      cmyk: "C: 0, M: 20, Y: 20, K: 90"
      pantone: "Black C"

photography_guidelines:

  visual_philosophy: |
    Our photography shows real athletes in real environments doing real things.
    We don't beautify or dramatize - we document truth. Images should inspire
    action for the planet and connection to wild places, not consumption.

  key_characteristics:
    - characteristic_1: "Authentic documentation"
      description: "Real expeditions, real moments. No models. Actual athletes
                    and ambassadors engaged in genuine activities."

    - characteristic_2: "Environmental context"
      description: "Show the landscape. Demonstrate why these places are worth
                    protecting. Product is secondary to place."

    - characteristic_3: "Gritty, not glamorous"
      description: "Dirt, sweat, weathered gear. Adventure is messy. Show the
                    reality, not the Instagram version."

  subject_matter:
    what_we_photograph:
      - "Patagonia ambassadors climbing, surfing, skiing in wild places"
      - "Environmental activism and restoration projects"
      - "Worn gear showing years of use (Worn Wear)"
      - "Manufacturing processes demonstrating quality and sustainability"

    what_we_avoid:
      - "Studio product shots (show product in use, not isolated)"
      - "Pristine models in pristine gear (not authentic)"
      - "Over-tourism destinations (promotes less-traveled places)"
      - "Any imagery that glorifies consumption over conservation"

  composition_principles:
    - "Wide environmental shots showing scale of landscape"
    - "Rule of thirds - subject often small in frame (humility in nature)"
    - "Natural framing through terrain features"
    - "Action captured mid-movement, not posed"

  lighting_style:
    preferred: "Natural light only - sunrise, golden hour, overcast, storms"
    mood: "Raw, honest, sometimes harsh (reflects reality of wilderness)"
    avoid: "Studio lighting, flash, artificial enhancement of 'beauty'"

  color_treatment:
    color_grading: "Minimal grading - true to scene as experienced"
    saturation: "Natural saturation levels - vivid when nature is vivid,
                 muted when conditions are muted"
    contrast: "Natural contrast - not artificially boosted"
    filters: "No filters. No Instagram effects. Document reality."

  authentic_vs_staged:
    philosophy: |
      We stage logistics (getting photographer in position) but never stage
      the moment. Capture what's actually happening. If it looks too perfect,
      it's probably not Patagonia.
    balance: "Technical excellence in capturing authentic moments"

  diversity_inclusion:
    representation_standards: |
      Outdoor sports have historically been white and male. We actively
      feature women, people of color, LGBTQ+ athletes, differently-abled
      adventurers. Show the outdoors belongs to everyone.
    geographic_diversity: "Not just Patagonia region - global wild places"
    avoid_stereotypes: "No 'token diversity'. Feature diverse athletes as
                        leaders and experts, not background decoration."

## 📝 NOTES

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Logo Complexity:**
- ❌ Logo with 7+ colors (reproduction nightmare)
- ✅ Logo works in single color (ultimate test)

**Color Accessibility Ignored:**
- ❌ Brand color fails WCAG contrast (illegible to millions)
- ✅ All color pairings tested for accessibility

**Typography Overload:**
- ❌ 4+ typefaces (visual chaos)
- ✅ 1-2 typefaces with multiple weights (elegant system)

**Photography Without Direction:**
- ❌ "Use authentic imagery" (too vague)
- ✅ "Natural light, rule of thirds, diverse subjects, warm tones" (actionable)

**Rules Without Rationale:**
- ❌ "Never use logo below 1 inch" (why?)
- ✅ "Logo illegible below 1 inch - details become mud" (understood)

**Applications Missing:**
- ❌ "Here's the logo and colors. Figure it out."
- ✅ Complete templates for every major touchpoint

### Usage Guidelines

**Who Uses This Document:**
