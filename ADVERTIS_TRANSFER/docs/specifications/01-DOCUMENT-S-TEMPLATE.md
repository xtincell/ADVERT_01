## 📝 NOTES

- Document S is the "executive version" - synthesizes, doesn't duplicate
- Should be readable by C-suite in 2-3 hours
- Executive Summary must stand alone (some execs only read this)
- Heavy use of visuals (infographics, charts, diagrams)
- Each section should answer "So what?" - implications clear
- Cross-references guide readers to detailed docs when needed
- Annual refresh recommended as strategy evolves

---

**STATUS:** Document S template complete ✓
**USAGE:** Master strategic document for all clients
**NEXT:** Document A (Authenticité)
