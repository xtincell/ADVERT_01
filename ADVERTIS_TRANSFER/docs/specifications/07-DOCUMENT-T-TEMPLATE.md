    captures_value: "[How metric reflects value to customer]"
    predicts_revenue: "[How metric leads to revenue (even if indirect)]"
    actionable: "[How teams can move this metric]"
    measurable: "[How we track it accurately]"

```

**Example (Airbnb):**
```yaml
north_star_metric:

  metric_name: "Nights Booked"

  metric_definition: |
    Total number of nights booked on Airbnb platform across all guests
    and all properties globally. A "night booked" counts when a reservation
    is confirmed (payment processed, not cancelled).

    Includes: All property types (entire homes, private rooms, shared rooms)
    Includes: All booking sources (app, web, partners)
    Excludes: Cancelled bookings
    Excludes: Experiences (separate product line)

  formula_calculation:
    formula: "Nights Booked = Σ (Check-out Date - Check-in Date) for all
              confirmed bookings in period"
    data_sources: "Reservation database, booking confirmation events"
    frequency: "Daily aggregation, weekly/monthly reporting"
    example: "User books 3-night stay in Paris → +3 nights booked
              User books 7-night stay in Tokyo → +7 nights booked
              February total: 45,000,000 nights booked globally"

  why_this_metric: |
    Nights Booked is Airbnb's North Star because it captures the ESSENCE
    of value created: connecting travelers with hosts for overnight stays.
    It directly measures the core transaction that Airbnb exists to facilitate.

    It's a leading indicator of revenue (more nights → more fees) but better
    than revenue because it focuses on volume of value delivery. A company
    could boost revenue by raising prices, but that might reduce nights booked
    (fewer travelers can afford it). Nights Booked keeps us honest about
    actually growing the pie, not just extracting more from existing pie.

    It's not "users" or "listings" because those are inputs, not outcomes.
    We could have millions of users who never book, or thousands of listings
    that sit empty. Nights Booked means actual matches happened, value
    exchanged, travelers housed, hosts earning income.

    Every team can contribute: Marketing (more awareness → bookings), Product
    (better search/trust → bookings), Pricing (optimal prices → bookings),
    Supply (more listings → bookings), Customer Service (solve issues → bookings).
    Everyone rallies around the same outcome.

  characteristics_of_good_nsm:
    captures_value: "Night in someone's home = value to traveler (shelter,
                     local experience) + value to host (income, cultural exchange)"
    predicts_revenue: "Airbnb takes ~3-15% commission per booking. More nights
                       = more revenue. Correlation ~0.95"
    actionable: "Teams can experiment to increase nights: improve search,
                 expand supply, better pricing, trust/safety features"
    measurable: "Precisely tracked in reservation system, real-time visibility"
    not_gameable: "Can't fake confirmed bookings. Requires actual transaction
                   (credit card charge, host acceptance, calendar block)"

  connection_to_business_model:
    business_model: "Two-sided marketplace (connect travelers + hosts),
                     commission on transactions"
    how_nsm_fits: "Marketplace success = liquidity (matching supply/demand).
                   Nights Booked = proof of liquidity. If nights growing,
                   marketplace is healthy. If nights flat/declining, something
                   broken (supply, demand, trust, friction)."

  targets:
    current_baseline: "400M nights booked (2023 annual)"
    short_term_3_6mo: "110M nights (Q1 2024) - 10% growth vs. Q1 2023"
    medium_term_12mo: "460M nights (2024 annual) - 15% YoY growth"
    long_term_24_36mo: "600M nights (2026) - 50% growth over 3 years"
    stretch_goal: "1B nights booked by 2030 (ambitious but possible)"

  nsm_drivers:
    - driver_1:
        name: "Guest Acquisition (new bookers)"
        relationship: "New guests → more nights booked (if they activate)"
        current_state: "5M new guests/quarter"
        improvement_potential: "Increase to 7M through marketing, referrals"

    - driver_2:
        name: "Repeat Booking Rate"
        relationship: "Guests who book again → more total nights"
        current_state: "40% of guests book 2+ times per year"
        improvement_potential: "Increase to 50% through email, personalization"

    - driver_3:
        name: "Booking Frequency (nights per booking)"
        relationship: "Longer stays → more nights per transaction"
        current_state: "Average 3.2 nights per booking"
        improvement_potential: "Encourage longer stays (monthly discounts, work-from-anywhere)"

    - driver_4:
        name: "Listing Supply (active listings)"
        relationship: "More unique listings → more choice → more bookings"
        current_state: "7M active listings"
        improvement_potential: "Expand to 10M through host acquisition, reactivation"

    - driver_5:
        name: "Conversion Rate (searches → bookings)"
        relationship: "Higher conversion → more nights from same traffic"
        current_state: "8% of searches result in booking"
        improvement_potential: "Improve to 10% through better search, pricing, trust"
```

    data_sources: "[Where data comes from]"
    example: "[Sample calculation]"

  why_it_matters: |
    [Why this metric is a primary KPI - its strategic importance]

    value: "[Current performance]"
    as_of: "[Date]"
    trend: "[Improving/Stable/Declining]"

  targets: *
    3_months: "[Target value]"
    6_months: "[Target value]"
    12_months: "[Target value]"
    rationale: "[Why these targets achievable/ambitious]"

  measurement_frequency: "[Daily/Weekly/Monthly]" *

  data_source: *
    primary: "[Main data source - tool/system]"
    backup: "[Alternative source for validation]"

  owner: *
    primary: "[Team/Role responsible for this metric]"
    executive_sponsor: "[C-level owner]"

  related_metrics:
    - "[Metric that influences this one]"
    - "[Metric that this one influences]"

  actions_to_improve:
    - action_1: "[Lever to pull to improve this metric]"
      expected_impact: "[Estimated improvement]"

    - action_2: [...]

  reporting:
    dashboard: "[Which dashboard shows this]"
    audience: "[Who monitors this regularly]"
    alert_threshold: "[When to escalate - e.g., drops below X]"
```

**Example (SaaS Company - Activation Rate):**
```yaml
primary_kpi_2:

  metric_name: "7-Day Activation Rate"
  metric_type: "Leading Indicator (predicts retention)"
  relationship_to_nsm: "Activated users retain 5x better → drive ARR (NSM)"

  definition: |
    Percentage of new signups who complete the "aha moment" activation
    criteria within 7 days of account creation. Activation = user has
    added 3+ team members AND created 5+ projects AND invited 1+ external
    collaborator (all three required).

  formula:
    calculation: "Activation Rate = (Users who hit activation criteria
                  within 7 days / Total new signups) × 100"
    data_sources: "Product analytics (Amplitude), user event tracking"
    example: "Week of Jan 1-7: 500 signups, 175 activated → 35% activation rate"

  why_it_matters: |
    Activation is the critical milestone where users "get it" and experience
    core value. Data shows activated users have 85% 6-month retention vs.
    15% for non-activated. Activation is 10x more predictive of LTV than
    any other early metric. Improving activation compounds - every 1%
    increase = $2M ARR annually at current scale.

  current_baseline:
    value: "32%"
    as_of: "2026-01-31"
    trend: "Stable (was 31% in Q4 2025, 30% in Q3)"

  targets:
    3_months: "36% (April 2026) - 4pp improvement"
    6_months: "40% (July 2026) - 8pp improvement"
    12_months: "45% (Jan 2027) - 13pp improvement"
    rationale: "Benchmarks show best-in-class SaaS achieves 45-50%.
                We have clear roadmap (better onboarding, activation nudges,
                team templates) that should enable 1pp/month improvement."

  measurement_frequency: "Daily (rolling 7-day cohort analysis)"

  data_source:
    primary: "Amplitude product analytics"
    backup: "Internal data warehouse (cross-validation)"

  owner:
    primary: "Product Team (Growth PM owns activation roadmap)"
    executive_sponsor: "Chief Product Officer"

  related_metrics:
    - "Time to Activation (how fast users activate)"
    - "Onboarding Completion Rate (step before activation)"
    - "7-Day Retention (result of activation)"

  actions_to_improve:
    - action_1: "Redesign onboarding flow (progressive disclosure, fewer steps)"
      expected_impact: "+3-5pp activation rate"

    - action_2: "Activation email sequence (day 1, 3, 5 nudges with tips)"
      expected_impact: "+2-3pp activation rate"

    - action_3: "In-app activation checklist (gamify progress)"
      expected_impact: "+1-2pp activation rate"

    - action_4: "Team templates (reduce friction of creating projects)"
      expected_impact: "+2-4pp activation rate"

  reporting:
    dashboard: "Product Dashboard (weekly review), Executive Dashboard (monthly)"
    audience: "Product team (daily), Leadership (weekly), Board (quarterly)"
    alert_threshold: "Alert if drops below 28% for 3 consecutive days"

## 📝 NOTES

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Too Many Metrics:**
- ❌ Tracking 100+ metrics (overwhelming, unfocused)
- ✅ North Star + 5-7 primary KPIs (clarity, alignment)

**Vanity Metrics:**
- ❌ "10M social media impressions!" (meaningless without context)
- ✅ "500 leads from social (10% conversion to customer)"

**No Baselines:**
- ❌ "We want to increase NPS" (from what? to what?)
- ✅ "Increase NPS from 42 to 55 in 12 months"

**Lagging Only:**
- ❌ Revenue as only metric (know too late to fix)
- ✅ Leading indicators (pipeline, activation) + lagging (revenue)

**Not Actionable:**
- ❌ "Brand awareness declined" (so what do we do?)
- ✅ "Unaided awareness down 5pp → increase content marketing 20%, test brand campaign"

### Usage Guidelines
