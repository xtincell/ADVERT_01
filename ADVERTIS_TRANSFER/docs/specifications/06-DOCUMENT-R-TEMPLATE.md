**Example (Social Media Crisis Risk):**
```yaml
risk_REP_01:

  risk_id: "REP-01"
  risk_name: "Viral Social Media Backlash Crisis"
  category: "Reputational"

  description: |
    A brand action, statement, product, or employee behavior sparks outrage
    on social media, leading to viral negative sentiment, boycott calls, and
    mainstream media coverage. The crisis damages brand reputation, customer
    trust, and potentially impacts sales.

    This could be triggered by perceived insensitivity, hypocrisy (actions
    contradicting stated values), cultural appropriation, tone-deaf marketing,
    or association with controversial figures/causes. The 24/7 social media
    environment means crises can escalate in hours, not days.

    If occurs: Hashtag campaigns, influencer criticism, media scrutiny, customer
    defection, employee morale damage, potential long-term brand equity loss.

  probability:
    rating: 4 (Likely - 60-90% chance)
    rationale: "Social media crises are common in our industry. Competitors
                have faced similar issues. Our brand takes values-driven
                stances, which can be polarizing. High brand visibility
                increases scrutiny."
    trend: "Increasing (social media sensitivity growing)"

  impact:
    rating: 4 (Major - severe damage)
    rationale: "Could cause 20-40% sales decline during crisis, lose key
                partnerships, damage employer brand. Recovery takes 12-24 months.
                Some customers lost permanently."
    affected_areas:
      - "Revenue (short-term sales impact)"
      - "Brand reputation (long-term equity damage)"
      - "Customer loyalty (trust erosion)"
      - "Employee morale (pride in brand)"
      - "Partnership relationships (brand safety concerns)"

  risk_score: "16 (Probability 4 × Impact 4 = HIGH RISK)"

  triggers:
    - "Marketing campaign deemed insensitive or appropriative"
    - "Executive makes controversial public statement"
    - "Product defect causes harm and response seems inadequate"
    - "Brand takes stance on divisive social/political issue"
    - "Employee behavior reflects poorly on company"

                values-driven brand). Mitigation reduces probability from 4 to 3
                (better prevention) and impact from 4 to 3 (faster response,
                better recovery). Remaining risk is within tolerance."

      stated_commitment: "We're in business to save our home planet. Every
                          decision prioritizes environmental impact."

      risks_of_contradiction:
        - risk:
            scenario: "Synthetic materials (polyester, nylon) are made from
                      petroleum, contributing to plastic pollution"
            example: "Activist points out fleeces shed microplastics"
            detection: "NGO research, journalist investigation"
            damage: "High - core value violation, 'greenwashing' accusations"

            example: "Making clothes in Asia, shipping globally = carbon footprint"
            detection: "Carbon footprint analysis, competitor comparison"
            damage: "Medium - contradicts climate commitment"

        - risk:

        - "Worn Wear program actively discourages buying new (repairs, resale)"
        - "1% for the Planet donations offset environmental cost"
        - "Carbon neutral operations (renewable energy, offsets)"
        - "Anti-consumption marketing ('Don't Buy This Jacket')"

**Example (Electric Vehicle Company - Worst Case Scenario):**
```yaml
scenario_3:

  scenario_name: "The Battery Crisis"
  scenario_type: "Worst Case / Black Swan"
  time_horizon: "3-5 years (2026-2030)"

  scenario_description: |
    A major flaw in lithium-ion battery technology is discovered - long-term
    degradation causes fire risk after 5-7 years. Multiple battery fires in
    EVs (across brands) cause public panic. Governments respond with
    emergency recalls and restrictive regulations.

    Consumer confidence in EVs collapses. Media coverage is relentlessly
    negative. Gas car sales rebound. EV adoption stalls or reverses. Major
    automakers scale back EV investments. Battery suppliers face lawsuits.

    Our brand, as EV leader, faces existential crisis. Massive recalls deplete
    cash reserves. Stock price crashes. Customers demand gas vehicle options.
    Decade of progress toward sustainable transportation reverses.

  key_drivers:
    - driver_1: "Battery technology safety"
      assumption: "Catastrophic flaw discovered (worst case)"

    - driver_2: "Public perception"
      assumption: "Fear dominates, rational analysis lost in panic"

    - driver_3: "Regulatory response"
      assumption: "Governments overreact with harsh restrictions"

    - driver_4: "Competitive dynamics"
      assumption: "Traditional automakers capitalize, return to gas focus"

  implications_for_strategy:
    positioning:
      impact: "EV-only positioning becomes liability. 'Sustainable leader'
               damaged if technology is unsafe."
      adjustment: "Must diversify powertrain options? Or double down on
                   battery innovation to solve crisis?"

    operations:
      impact: "Massive recall costs, manufacturing disruption, supply chain chaos"
      adjustment: "Battery replacement program, enhanced safety protocols,
                   potentially retool for alternative powertrains"

    financial:
      impact: "Catastrophic. Recall costs $5-10B+, sales plummet 60-80%,
               stock price collapses, may face bankruptcy without capital raise"
      projection: "Cash burn $1B+/quarter during crisis"

    brand:
      impact: "Brand equity severely damaged. Trust destroyed. May take
               decade+ to recover if recoverable at all."
      adjustment: "Full transparency, aggressive safety response, potentially
                   rebrand or pivot business model"

  opportunities_to_seize:
    - "If we solve the battery problem first, emerge as safety leader"
    - "Acquire struggling competitors at discount prices"
    - "Pivot to battery innovation company (license technology)"

  threats_to_mitigate:
    - "Bankruptcy risk from recall costs + sales collapse"
    - "Talent exodus (employees lose faith)"
    - "Supplier collapse (entire ecosystem at risk)"
    - "Regulatory ban on technology we've built everything on"

  strategic_adjustments_needed:
    immediate_actions:
      - "Activate crisis management team"
      - "Secure emergency financing ($5-10B credit facility)"
      - "Halt production, conduct immediate safety audit"
      - "Transparent communication (do not hide or minimize)"
      - "Mobilize engineering team for battery solution"

    long_term_adaptations:
      - "Diversify powertrain technology (hydrogen, hybrid options?)"
      - "Build battery safety expertise as new competitive advantage"
      - "Restructure business model (software/services revenue?)"
      - "Consider strategic merger or partnership for survival"

  probability: "5% (Low probability but high-impact tail risk)"

  early_warning_indicators:
    - indicator_1: "Battery fire incidents increasing across industry"
      measurement: "NHTSA reports, media coverage, insurance claims"

    - indicator_2: "Battery degradation research showing concerning patterns"
      measurement: "Academic research, internal testing data"

    - indicator_3: "Regulatory inquiries into battery safety"
      measurement: "Government investigation announcements"

    - indicator_4: "Short-seller reports questioning battery longevity"
      measurement: "Financial research, activist short campaigns"

## 📝 NOTES

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Generic Risk Lists:**
- ❌ "Competitive pressure, economic downturn, key person risk" (every company says this)
- ✅ Brand-specific risks tied to unique position

**Underestimating Reputational Risk:**
- ❌ "Reputation not quantified, treated as soft risk"
- ✅ Calculate brand equity at stake, customer lifetime value impact

**Crisis Plans Too Slow:**
- ❌ "48-hour response timeline" (social media crisis needs 4-hour response)
- ✅ Realistic timelines for digital age

**No Practice:**
- ❌ "Playbook exists but never tested"
- ✅ Annual crisis simulation exercises
